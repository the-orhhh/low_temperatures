\begin{abstract}

The process of detecting atmospheric muons and measuring their decay time, as observed inside a plastic scintillator, is presented. Atmospheric muons, produced by the decay of charged pions, decay inside a plastic scintillator according to the $\mu^-\to\nu_\mu+e^-+\bar\nu_e$ channel, as well as its charge conjugate; the resulting electron is detected following the initial detection of the passing muon, processing the two timestamps into measurements of the muon lifetime. A lifetime of $\tau= 2.062\pm0.050\ [\mu\text s]$ was measured and analysed.
